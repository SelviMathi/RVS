10.Given an integer N, return true if N is a power of two else return false.
An integer N is a power of two if an integer X exists such as N==2powX.
Example 1:
Input: N=1 			Output: true (2pow0==1)
Example 2:
Input: N=16		Output: true (2pow4==16)
Example 3:
Input: N=18		Output: false

11.We use the integers a, b, and n  to create the following series:
(a+2^0 *b),(a+2^0 *b+2^1*b) , (a+2^0 *b+2^1*b +2^2*b), …… (a+2^0 *b+2^1*b+2^2*b+....+2^n-1  * b)  
You are given a, b, and n. For given a, b, and n print the series of numbers.
Constraint:
0<=a,b<=50
0<=n<=15
