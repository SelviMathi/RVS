1.Write a program to accept N values into an integer array and display the contents of the array in the reverse order.
2.Write a  program to count the number of 0s and 1s in an array that is in random order. You may assume that the array consists of only 0s and 1s.
3.Write a  program to print the count of the elements in an array whose values are lesser than a key element in an unsorted array.
4.Write a  Program to print all the repeated elements in a sorted array.
5.Write a program to search an element in the given array and print the searched elements index. If no such elements were found print -1
6.You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array . 
Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
7.Write a program  to replace every element in an array with the sum of its right side elements
8.Write a program  to reverse the array elements
9.Write a program  to insert the value at given position in the array.
10.Write a program  to delete the value at given position from the array.
11.Write a program  to swap every pair of  adjacent array elements
12.Write a program  to left rotate for given times of an array elements
13.Given an array X with n number of elements, return true if the given array X is sorted else return false. You may consider multiple positions may be shifted in the array X. 
Example 1: Input: X=[1,2,3,4,5] Output: true 
Example 2: Input: X=[3,4,5, 1,2,] Output: true
 Example 3: Input: X=[3,1,2,4,5] Output: false
14.Write a program  to remove the duplicates in an array .
15.Write a program  to find second largest and second smallest in array
16.You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.
Examples
Input:
 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output:
 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation:
 All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
17. Given two sorted arrays, find their union and intersection.
Input: arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
        arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6} 
Output: Union : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
         Intersection : {3, 5}
